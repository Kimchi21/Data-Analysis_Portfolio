# Data Analysis Portfolio

Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains personal data analysis projects that I have done utilizing Python, SQL, Excel and PowerBI. Below are some of my highlighted projects, including data visualization, statistical analysis, and data-driven insights. 

For these projects, I start by conducting most of my analysis using Python. Additionally, I perform some minor analysis or adjustments in Excel. To replicate the analysis in a database environment, I simulated it in MySQL by uploading the data to my local MySQL instance. Ultimately, I visualized the results and findings by creating a PowerBI dashboard.

These projects reflect my skills in handling diverse datasets and extracting meaningful conclusions to support decision-making. Feel free to check them out and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimmarcialvallesteros/) for any questions or feedback.

## Automobile Sales Analysis
In this [project](https://github.com/Kimchi21/Data-Analysis_Portfolio/tree/main/Automobile%20Sales), I used a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze sales transaction insights, product line performance, and customer and geographic data to provide management, prospective buyers, and stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of automobile sales patterns, enabling informed decision-making. I also conducted a forecast using Facebook's/Meta's Prophet model to see how sales will go for the rest of the year 2020. By utilizing the Prophet model I was able to uncover the sales seasonality and trends.
